# this class can collect dependency data (which are an array of hashes).
# the collected data can be added as either marshaled stream of dependency
# data or marshaled stream of rzipped gemspec files.
#
# the basic idea is either to merge those dependency data and then
# marshal them again. or to have an array of dependecy data and
# split or group with their gemname as criterium.
