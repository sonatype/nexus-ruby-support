    body: There is an incompatibility between the way Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 handles digests. This DigestAdapter will take a pre-1.8.6 digest and adapt it to the 1.8.6 API.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Note that only the digest and hexdigest methods are adapted, since these are the only functions used by RubyGems.
