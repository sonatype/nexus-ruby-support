Nexus Ruby Support
==================

This repository contains components and Nexus plugins to enhance Nexus with Ruby support. Stay tuned!

This plugin is powered by JRuby.

Prerequisites
-----

Use Maven 3 for this build.

Add the repositories list in this section to your repository group. This might be a bit confusing, this build assumes that you are using Nexus as a repository manager and that you've configure your Maven Settings to hit a repository group.  This group needs to contain the following proxy repositories: 

  * The Sonatype Forge Repository: http://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/forge
  * The Codehaus Snapshot Repository: http://snapshots.repository.codehaus.org
  
There's one more repository you'll need to configure and that is
the Torquebox GEM repository here:

  * Torquebox GEM repository: http://rubygems-proxy.torquebox.org/releases

If you've successfully configured these repositories, you should be able to run the build as it is described below.    There's a problem running the nexus-ruby-plugin-its project, if you try to buld this project you may receive an error similar to the following:

    Execution default of goal de.saumya.mojo:runit-maven-plugin:0.29.1:test failed: 
    Plugin de.saumya.mojo:runit-maven-plugin:0.29.1 or one of its dependencies could 
    not be resolved: Failed to collect dependencies for de.saumya.mojo:runit-maven-plugin:jar:0.29.1 (): 
    No versions available for rubygems:shoulda-context:gem:[1.0,1.99999] within specified range -> [Help 1]
    
The (unsatisfying) solution to this problem is to simply skip building this nexus-ruby-plugin-its project altogether.    The important projects, the projects that produce the output you need are nexus-gem and nexus-ruby-plugin.   Good luck.

The Nexus gem requires net-http-persistent to run, install it:

    gem install net-http-persistent


Build
-----

    mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip
	 
after that you will find the nexus plugin in **nexus-ruby-plugin/target/nexus-ruby-plugin-*-bundle.zip** and the gem with the nexus rubygems command in **nexus-gem/target/nexus-*.gem**.

install the nexus gem for you local ruby environment with

    gem install -l nexus-gem/target/nexus-*.gem

install the nexus plugin into your nexus server with

    unzip -d $NEXUS_HOME/nexus/WEB-INF/plugin-repository/ -o nexus-ruby-plugin/target/nexus-ruby-plugin-*-SNAPSHOT-bundle.zip

nexus command
-------------

when pushing a gem to the nexus rubygems repo the first time the url of the repo and the credentials are prompted. these data will be stored in $HOME/.gem/nexus.

    gem nexus my-1.0.gem

using nexus ruby repo
---------------------

with this you can list the latest versions of the gems from the nexus rubygems repo (mind the trailing slash !!)

    gem list --remote --clear-sources --source http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/rubygems/my-repo/

using nexus rubygem repo with rubygems add it as source with (mind the trailing slash !!)

    gem sources --add http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/rubygems/my-repo/
	
now you can install the gems from that repo

    gem install my
	
enjoy !
